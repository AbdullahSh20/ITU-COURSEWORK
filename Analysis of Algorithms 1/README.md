# Analysis of Algorithms 1 BLG335E

This repository contains the assignments for the BLG335E course for the year 2023/2024. 

- [Project 1](./Project1): In this Project we wrote the quicksort algorithm with multiple implementation methods and calculated its execution times across multiple datasets to analyze its runtime.
- [Project 2](./Project2): In this Project we created a max heap datastructure. Used it to create the heapsort algorithm, a priority queue, and a d-ary heap structure we also calculated the execution times for multiple operations across multiple datasets to analyze their runtime.
- [Project 3](./Project3): In this Project we created a binary heap datastructure and a red and black tree structure with their relative operations. We compared the differences in running times between both structures across multiple datasets.
