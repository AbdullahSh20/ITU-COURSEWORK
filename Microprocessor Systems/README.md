## General remarks about the class

The slides given in class are like summaries. While studying ask any AI tool (chatgpt, Bard....) to explain the slides for you to get a better grasp of the topics. I found this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w35mevvdQbI&list=PLvkMefp2ClcYfqKImpN2CWRzgO5kt4f6o) helpful for the basics of this class too.
