# Numerical Methods BLG202E
I did not like the class to be honest so my opinion is a bit biased. The subject seems easy and many of my friends say it is, but I found it hard and I didnt enjoy studying for it at all, it was just memorizing algorithms instead of learning. The homeworks were easy since it was just implementation of the alogrithim asked by the professor.
